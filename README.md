# working_with_neural_nets

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help create a binary classifier to predict whether organization applicants would be succesful if supported through funding.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS"

- IS_SUCCESSFUL

- "EIN", "NAME"

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model

- I chose the in three separate attempts to change the machine learning model by adding neurons to the first hidden layer, adding a second hidden layer, and changing the first hidden layers activation to tanh respectively. Each attempt incrementally changed the model to see if any specific change would have a significant effect.

- I was not able to change the model performance to be better than 72.9%

- The model was not able to be increased under its current parameters

## Summary

The completed project seems be close to effective but not ideal.
